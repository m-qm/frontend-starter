# PROJECT MODULE 3

## Description

This backend will provide an API to retreive a list of users, playlists and personal information.

## User Stories

-  **404:** As an anon/user I can see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault
-  **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can start saving favorite playlists and create a profile
-  **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can see my favorite playlists
-  **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it
-  **Add music** As a user I can add a song so that I can share it with the community
-  **See playlists** As a user I can see the playlists

## Backlog

-  **List artists** As a user I want to see a list of artists so that I can get to know them and listen their tracks
-  **Search artists** As a user I want to search artists by name so that I know if it is already in the platform
-  **Filter artists** As a user I want to filter artists by style so that I can discover new talents
-  **Add to favorites** As a user I want to add a artist to favorite so that I can save the artists that I liked the most
